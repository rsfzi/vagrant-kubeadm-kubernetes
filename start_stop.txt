We have had hard DC crashes and when bringing things back up, we just made sure the control plane was up before our nodes and things have come back fine.

We have also powered off our cluster(s) before and for the most part did this:

1.  Scale all applications down to 0 excluding cluster services e.g. CNI DaemonSets, DNS etc.
2.  Drain all nodes excluding the control plane.
3.  Shut down nodes.
4.  Shut down all components but kube-apiserver and etcd. â€“ If using kubelet to manage components (kubeadm), just move the manifests out of the /etc/kubernetes/manifests dir and kubelet will stop the containers gracefully.
5.  shut down kube-apiserver
6.  Stop kubelet on control plane, just ensure the etcd leader is the last one to be stopped.
7.  Backup dirs/etcd if needed.

Bringing it backup is essentially the opposite order.
